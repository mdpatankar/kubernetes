## 3. Access Kubernetes Cluster using Web Terminal

Once the cluster is provisioned, the kubernetes client CLI `kubectl` needs to be
configured to talk to the provisioned cluster.

This can also be done using your local desktops. You will have to install IBM Cloud Plugin Tools for doing that.

For this lab, you will be using Web Terminal, to work with your cluster. So installations on client machines is not required.
This feature is in beta currently. 

a. Access the Cluster, and go to Cluster details

     alt="Markdown Monster icon"
     style="float: left; margin-right: 10px;" />   

b. Click on "Web terminal(beta) "
<img src="./img/webterm2.png"
     alt="Markdown Monster icon"
     style="float: left; margin-right: 10px;" /> 

c. Web based terminal opens at the bottom of the browser.     
<img src="./img/webterm3.png"
     alt="Markdown Monster icon"

Once your open the Web based terminal, you are ready to explore Kubernetes Objects.

## Pod: Managing pods with kubectl

Use kubectl combined with instructions in a YAML file to do
anything you'd like

   ```
	kubectl create -f <name>.yaml
  
   ```

For e.g. nginx.yaml

    ```
	apiVersion: v1 
	kind: Pod 
	metadata:
  	  name: mypod
  	  namespace: default 
    spec:
      containers:
      - name: nginx
        image: nginx

   
To get all the pods , running in your default namespace

    ```
 		kubectl get pods


Get More details about your pod, shows all details about a pod, including information about containers running within

     ```
		kubectl describe pods 
	
		kubectl describe pod mypod	


To Edit live pod, you can do  	

 	```
		kubectl edit pod mypod 

 	
 	
## Services:



	```
	apiVersion: v1
	kind: Service
	metadata:
  	   name: kubia
	spec:
  	  ports:
  	  - port: 80                1
        targetPort: 8080        2
	  selector:                 3
    	app: kubia              3
    
    ```



1 The port this service will be available on
2 The container port the service will forward to
3 All pods with the app=kubia label will be part of this service.
Youâ€™re defining a service called kubia, which will accept connections on port 80 and route each connection to port 8080 of one of the pods matching the app=kubia label selector.

Go ahead and create the service by posting the file using kubectl create.
